# Road Map 
**0.7.0**:
* Implement cache diffing
* Implement SOTs to enable cluster diffing
* Implement cluster diffing so we can install only those kapps that need 
  installing and to destroy those that need removing
* Catch up on tests

**0.8.0**:
* Use acquirers to acquire manifests/vars files from git repos as well as local files 

**0.9.0**:
* Disambiguate when multiple Makefiles, etc. are found
